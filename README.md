# What this bot is

This is my personal sniffer that checks my channel for redeemed channel messages, and reacts to it by overlays or it plays audio.  

If you want to try stuff yourself, the files in the try-it-yourself folder might be something for you to check out.

**Credits:**
This is based on [Instafluff's ComfyJS](https://github.com/instafluff/ComfyJS). Thank him for the library!
Also shoutouts to [Vuurvos1](https://github.com/Vuurvos1/) for the idea and help with the audio queue.
